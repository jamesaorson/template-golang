# `/docs`

Design and user documents (in addition to your godoc generated documentation).

If you want a live webpage, you can serve the `docs/` directory with Github Pages.

Examples:

* https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tree/master/docs
* https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/docs
* https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tree/master/docs
